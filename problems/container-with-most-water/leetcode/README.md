## Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `height` of length `n`. There are `n` vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the `ith` line are `(i, 0)` and `(i, height[i])`.

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return _the maximum amount of water a container can store_.

**Notice** that you may not slant the container.

 

**Example 1:**

**Input:** height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
**Output:** 49
**Explanation:** The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** height = [1,1]
**Output:** 1

 

**Constraints:**

	- `n == height.length`

	- `2 <= n <= 105`

	- `0 <= height[i] <= 104`

## Hints

<details>
<summary>Hint 1</summary>

If you simulate the problem, it will be O(n^2) which is not efficient.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 2</summary>

Try to use two-pointers. Set one pointer to the left and one to the right of the array. Always move the pointer that points to the lower line.

How can you calculate the amount of water at each step?

## Solutions

```Python3
class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        left, right = 0, len(height)-1
        maxArea = float('-inf')
        while left < right:
            currArea = min(height[left], height[right]) * (right-left)
            maxArea = max(maxArea, currArea)

            if height[left] < height[right]:
                left += 1
            else:
                right -= 1
        return maxArea
```

## AI Review

### 1. Complexity
*   **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the `height` list. The pointers traverse the list once.
*   **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as only a few variables are stored regardless of input size.

### 2. Correctness
The solution is **correct** and handles standard edge cases (e.g., minimum list length of 2, identical heights, or strictly increasing/decreasing heights). Using `float('-inf')` is safe here since areas are non-negative, though `0` is more idiomatic.

### 3. Optimization
While the logic is optimal, you can slightly improve performance by **skipping redundant calculations**. After moving a pointer, you can continue moving it if the new height is less than or equal to the previously "limiting" height. This avoids expensive `min`/`max` calls for configurations that mathematically cannot yield a larger area.

### 4. Key Algorithmic Pattern
**Two-Pointer (Greedy Approach).** By starting at the widest possible interval and always moving the pointer pointing to the shorter line, the algorithm greedily searches for a taller line that might compensate for the shrinking width.
