## Problem Statement

Koko loves to eat bananas. There are `n` piles of bananas, the `ith` pile has `piles[i]` bananas. The guards have gone and will come back in `h` hours.

Koko can decide her bananas-per-hour eating speed of `k`. Each hour, she chooses some pile of bananas and eats `k` bananas from that pile. If the pile has less than `k` bananas, she eats all of them instead and will not eat any more bananas during this hour.

Koko likes to eat slowly but still wants to finish eating all the bananas before the guards return.

Return _the minimum integer_ `k` _such that she can eat all the bananas within_ `h` _hours_.

 

**Example 1:**

**Input:** piles = [3,6,7,11], h = 8
**Output:** 4

**Example 2:**

**Input:** piles = [30,11,23,4,20], h = 5
**Output:** 30

**Example 3:**

**Input:** piles = [30,11,23,4,20], h = 6
**Output:** 23

 

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= piles.length <= 104`

	- `piles.length <= h <= 109`

	- `1 <= piles[i] <= 109`

## Solutions

```Python3
class Solution:
    def minEatingSpeed(self, piles: List[int], h: int) -> int:
        def feasible(speed):
            return sum( (pile - 1) // speed + 1 for pile in piles) <= h

        left , right = 1, max(piles)

        while left < right:
            mid = left + (right - left) // 2

            if feasible(mid):
                right = mid
            else:
                left = mid + 1
        return left
```

## AI Review

### 1. Complexity
*   **Time Complexity:** $O(N \log M)$, where $N$ is the number of piles and $M$ is the maximum number of bananas in a single pile (`max(piles)`). The binary search takes $\log M$ steps, each requiring an $O(N)$ pass.
*   **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as it uses a constant amount of extra space.

### 2. Correctness
The code is **correct**.
*   **Ceiling Math:** `(pile - 1) // speed + 1` correctly implements `ceil(pile / speed)` using integer division.
*   **Bounds:** The range `[1, max(piles)]` is sufficient because eating faster than the largest pile does not reduce the total time (one pile per hour limit).
*   **Edge Cases:** Handles $h = \text{len(piles)}$ (returns `max(piles)`) and very large $h$ correctly.

### 3. Concrete Optimization
**Narrow the search range:**
Instead of `left = 1`, use `left = (sum(piles) - 1) // h + 1`. 
The theoretical minimum speed is the total bananas divided by total hours. This reduces the number of iterations in the binary search, especially when $h$ is much larger than the number of piles.

### 4. Key Algorithmic Pattern
**Binary Search on Answer:** Used when the solution space is monotonic (if speed $k$ works, any speed $> k$ also works).
