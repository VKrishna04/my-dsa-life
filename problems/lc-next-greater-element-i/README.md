## Problem Statement

The **next greater element** of some element `x` in an array is the **first greater** element that is **to the right** of `x` in the same array.

You are given two **distinct 0-indexed** integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, where `nums1` is a subset of `nums2`.

For each `0 <= i < nums1.length`, find the index `j` such that `nums1[i] == nums2[j]` and determine the **next greater element** of `nums2[j]` in `nums2`. If there is no next greater element, then the answer for this query is `-1`.

Return _an array _`ans`_ of length _`nums1.length`_ such that _`ans[i]`_ is the **next greater element** as described above._

 

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums1 = [4,1,2], nums2 = [1,3,4,2]
**Output:** [-1,3,-1]
**Explanation:** The next greater element for each value of nums1 is as follows:
- 4 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.
- 1 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. The next greater element is 3.
- 2 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums1 = [2,4], nums2 = [1,2,3,4]
**Output:** [3,-1]
**Explanation:** The next greater element for each value of nums1 is as follows:
- 2 is underlined in nums2 = [1,2,3,4]. The next greater element is 3.
- 4 is underlined in nums2 = [1,2,3,4]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.

 

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= nums1.length <= nums2.length <= 1000`

	- `0 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 104`

	- All integers in `nums1` and `nums2` are **unique**.

	- All the integers of `nums1` also appear in `nums2`.

 

**Follow up:** Could you find an `O(nums1.length + nums2.length)` solution?

    def nextGreaterElement(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        stack = []
        d = {}

        for n in nums2:

        return [d[x] for x in nums1]

        #     ans.append(a)
            

            # print(i)
            # for j in range(count, len(nums2)):
            #     print(f"i -> {i} j -> {j}")

            #         j = -1
            #         break
            #     if (nums1[i] <= nums2[j]):
            #         print("<=")
            #         j += 1

            #         print(f"{i} {nums1[i]} > found at {j} {nums2[j]}")
            #         ans.append(j)
            #         break
        
        # return ans

## AI Review

### 1. Complexity
*   **Time**: $O(n + m)$, where $n$ is the length of `nums2` and $m$ is the length of `nums1`. Each element in `nums2` is pushed and popped from the stack exactly once.
*   **Space**: $O(n)$ to store the dictionary mapping and the stack.

### 2. Correctness
The solution is **correct**. It accurately identifies the first greater element to the right for each number. Since the problem guarantees all integers in `nums1` and `nums2` are unique, the hash map (`d`) safely stores values without collisions.

### 3. Optimization
You can remove the second `for` loop that sets `-1` for remaining stack elements. Instead, use the `.get()` method with a default value during the final list comprehension:
```python
return [d.get(x, -1) for x in nums1]
```
This is more idiomatic and slightly faster as it avoids an explicit secondary pass over the stack.

### 4. Key Algorithmic Pattern
**Monotonic Stack**: Specifically, a monotonic decreasing stack. This pattern is the standard approach for "Next Greater/Smaller Element" problems to reduce an $O(n^2)$ nested loop search to linear time.
