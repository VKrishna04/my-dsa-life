## Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, return _the number of **palindromic substrings** in it_.

A string is a **palindrome** when it reads the same backward as forward.

A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters within the string.

 

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "abc"
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** Three palindromic strings: "a", "b", "c".

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "aaa"
**Output:** 6
**Explanation:** Six palindromic strings: "a", "a", "a", "aa", "aa", "aaa".

 

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= s.length <= 1000`

	- `s` consists of lowercase English letters.

## Hints

<details>
<summary>Hint 1</summary>

How can we reuse a previously computed palindrome to compute a larger palindrome?

</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 2</summary>

If “aba” is a palindrome, is “xabax” a palindrome? Similarly is “xabay” a palindrome?

</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 3</summary>

Complexity based hint:
If we use brute force and check whether for every start and end position a substring is a palindrome we have O(n^2) start - end pairs and O(n) palindromic checks. Can we reduce the time for palindromic checks to O(1) by reusing some previous computation?

## AI Review

### Review of Palindromic Substrings Solution

**1. Complexity**
*   **Time Complexity:** $O(N^2)$. The outer loop runs $2N-1$ times (covering all possible centers), and the inner `while` loop expands up to $N/2$ times in the worst case (e.g., "aaaaa").
*   **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$. The algorithm uses only a few integer variables regardless of input size.

**2. Correctness**
The solution is **correct**. By using the $2N-1$ center logic, it elegantly handles both odd-length palindromes (centered on a character) and even-length palindromes (centered between characters). It handles edge cases like single-character strings ($N=1$) and strings with no multi-character palindromes correctly.

**3. Optimization**
While $O(N^2)$ is standard for this problem, **Manacher’s Algorithm** can optimize the time complexity to **$O(N)$**. It achieves this by reusing work from previously processed palindromes via a "mirror" property, though it is significantly more complex to implement.

**4. Key Algorithmic Pattern**
**Expand Around Center.** This pattern avoids the $O(N^2)$ space requirement of Dynamic Programming by identifying all $2N-1$ potential midpoints and expanding outwards as long as the palindrome property holds.
